- dream small. or at least plan small. if I did a 7 day game jam again, I would pick something that I think is achievable in 4 days. that gives me 3 days to have fun with my prototype and add things to it.
- no asset packs, or at least very few. I saw all these people doing amazing things in very creative ways, while I was sitting there, miserable, scrolling itch to find a passable sprite. I think I would next time pick an art style early on, one that is very minimalistic, and ugly, but kinda consistent, and try to learn it in a few hours.
