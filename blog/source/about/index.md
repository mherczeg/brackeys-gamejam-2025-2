# About Me

Hi, my name is Máté, and I am a long time software dev, who recently started to learn making games instead of banking software. Only couple months into my journey I decided to join [Brackeys Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14). 

This is the blog where I'm going to document how it went. 

I should probably tell more, but the week is short, and I gotta get coding. Maybe I will update this later, if I don't forget.
