Basic gameplay loop achieved. Very basic. We have [encounters happening](/brackeys-gamejam-2025-2/images/core-gamplay-loop-1.mp4), and we have money and inventory management (aka [shop](/brackeys-gamejam-2025-2/images/shop-1.mp4)).

Some things are missing. Encounters do not loop into each other, for now I'm starting each encounter manually with devtools. Shop is not auto opening every 10 encounters or so, I'm opening it manually. Mixed product is evaluated, but the result is just printed to the log (the vision is that adding liked ingredients will result in tips, while adding disliked ingredient, or not producing the requested product will reduce health. Health can be restored at the shop.)
These things are quite achievable in a couple hours and I am not worried about them.

What I am worried about is the customer database, and the discovery of likes dislikes. I think that is necessary to achieve "enjoyable gameplay status", and we may not have the time for them.

Anyway, tomorrow we're doing ✨✨Art✨✨. We'll see how it goes. If I can achieve passable by the end of the day, I may reduce the two days art budget to a single day, and maybe come back for a second pass on Saturday.
