Well, it has come. The dreaded Art Day. Will take a crack at visuals first, as I expect audio to be easier (in fact I expect to do audio tomorrow). Includes both getting most of the sprites in place, as well as making the UI presentable.  

What we need:
- a nice environment for the customer pane
- final sprites for the NCPs
    - a little bit of animation tween could be nice, but low prio
- speech bubbles
    - highlighting text would be welcome, but low prio
- the background for the mixing area (though this could be an extension of the customer pane)
- a billion sprites for all the resources
    - at the very least replace the placeholders with something that can be used later
- transparent background style label
    - for the money
    - for the messaging in product details
- order details box
- current mix box
- product details box

I purposefully left out the ingredient selector as I want to redo it a bit. An inventory in the left side, the mixer is filled from there, instead of the popup solution.

Tooltips would be nice, at least on the icons for now.

Also need to finalize viewport sizing, and maybe do a web build to make sure things still fit.
