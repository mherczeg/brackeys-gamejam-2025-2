Well, progress was certainly made. It was a longer day than I wanted, but I was determined to hit the goal. For the most part I succeeded, though that is mostly thanks to defining the goal very vaguely. 

Yes, the mixing core mechanic is there, but a lot of small things are missing. There are no unknown effects, nor effect discovery, which is the whole point of the game. The "Mix It" button does not actually do anything. The same ingredient can be selected multiple times, and the ingredient list actually just includes every possible ingredient, there is no inventory or similar. It would be nice to sort them better as well...

It's not much honestly, but we definitely have [rectangles doing things on the screen](/brackeys-gamejam-2025-2/images/first-prototype.mp4).

I am not too disappointed at how this went, but still worry about the scoping, so I'll definitely treat a lot of the [initial plans](/brackeys-gamejam-2025-2/2025/08/25/day-1-plans-and-dreams/) as optional upgrades.

For the moment I am happy with the code quality, though I definitely felt it slip towards the end of the day. 

Couple decisions that will be interesting to reflect back on:
- All the content went into resources, I'm curious how it will work out when it's time to replace all the placeholders
- I ended up favoring Control nodes very heavily (I'm using Godot. Did I mention that before? Not sure.), which is very different from all my previous attempts at making games, which were generally TileMap based.

Anyways, I am calling it a day here, long day tomorrow.
