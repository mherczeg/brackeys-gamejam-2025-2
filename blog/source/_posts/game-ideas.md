Our glorious theme is "Risk it to Biscuit".

So, I have been spending Sunday thinking about what to do with this. I looked at the dictionary, I looked at wikipedia,scribbled [words on paper](/brackeys-gamejam-2025-2/images/first-notes.jpg). I asked [gemini](/brackeys-gamejam-2025-2/logs/gemini-ideas.txt).

By the end of the day I had 4 possible ideas (and several impossible ones):

1. **Puzzle Platformer/Maze Solver** (this is what I came up with while thinking about making a heist game)
    - *The pitch*: you are a dog, and you want to get the dog biscuit, which the owner keeps hiding in ever-harder to reach places. 
    
        In case of a platformer this would be in the kitchen sink, on the top of the wardrobe, in the chimney, and that's the level, and you puzzle platform all the way up.

        In case of a maze solver, it's more like the Untitled Goose Game, just with a dog PC, and a biscuit end goal.

    - *Pros*: people like dogs?
    - *Cons*: Good puzzles are hard to make in a short time. Also don't like that this game could be submitted to any jam, the theme is just kinda slapped on it as a coat of paint. Also I am not that interested in making puzzle platformer no. 6 billion. 
 
2. **Physics based platformer** (this idea came from gemini)
   - *The pitch*: a very vertical platformer, where none of the tiles/surfaces are locked in place, instead they are each resting on another tile/platform, and have full collision, and weight. Picture a very unstable Jenga tower. The player tries to platform their way up, but they never know if a platform will take their weight or crumble. 
    - *Pros*: somehow seems much more on topic with the risky jumps, and also different enough from most platformers to be interesting. The physics engine would carry a large portion of the game, and those are largely third party libraries these days, so a prototype would easily fit the timeframe.
    - *Cons*: I am still not that interested in making platformers.
  
3. **Day Trader** (both me and gemini had this idea)
   - *The pitch*: you are a guy sitting in front of a computer, looking at graphs, buying and selling stocks, trying to move your net-worth up. The game simulates the stocks lifecycle, and there could be context clues in newspaper articles and evening news clips that hints at future price movement. The goal is to increase net-worth of course. The player's toolset would start out from buying or shorting stocks, but as upgrades all kinds of investment "techniques" could be unlocked: pump&dumps, naked shorting, insider trading, and even industrial espionage and sabotage. 
   - *Pros*: Very on theme, which I love. Does not require a lot of art skill, which I don't have anyway. I also legitimately think a game like this could be fun, if enough interactivity is added.
   - *Cons*: Unfortunately the secret sauce I think would be making the graph-play satisfying. This means it have to be very easy and intuitive to make and combine graphs in the "Bloomberg terminal", but also we have to make it so the player can figure things out based on them. Basically if the graphs only purpose is to be green or red, then this is a bad game. If the graph or multiple graphs together forecasts what the player should buy, or at least help them solve something, basically if the graphs are interactive, this is a good game. Figuring this out is pretty much impossible in a week.

4. **Vending machine gremlin**
    - *The pitch*: Anyone out there old enough to remember Morrowind? It had an alchemy system, where you combine 2-4 ingredients, each ingredients having 2-4 effects, and those would make up the effects in you potion (you needed at least two of the same effect I think). The players initially did not know the ingredients' effects though, they needed to read about it (I may be making this part up) or just keep combining things to learn what they do. And in a pinch, when you really needed a potion, you could ***risk*** using an ingredient with unknown effects. Maybe it would complete the intended potions, maybe it would activate previously inactive unwanted effects. Vending Machine Gremlin's Core gameplay loop is this. You are a gremlin, working inside a vending machine, and when people walk up and hit a button on the machine, you mix up their product, as you do, you slowly learn what your ingredients do.
    - *Pros*: It seems very doable in a week and it actually has risk/reward as a core element of the gameplay loop. Most importantly, I like this idea.
    - *Cons*: Is this just a cooking game? I don't really play them, so I'm 


I am going with **Vending Machine Gremlin**.
