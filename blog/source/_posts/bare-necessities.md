Last evening the migraine struck, so had to cut the day short. Still, managed to get most of the customers arriving, placing orders, and leaving in place.

Also added an import tool that converts json files to resources, it will be helpful to replace all the placeholder content.

I had a bit of time left, so I started working on handling the unknown ingredient effects in the mixer, but due to the migraine, and being tired, I just made a mess of it, so I left it.

Today though, the project seems a bit more impossible than the day before. I am supposed to be finishing up the core gameplay loop, so I can start doing the art tomorrow.

The issue is, for this to be a remotely fun game, I think I would need about 3 days of solid coding.

I will give it a shot, but I am skeptical.

At the very least for the game to function I need:
- the encounter needs to be hooked up to the mixer, and the mixer needs to display the expected recipe
- the mixer needs to show if there could be unknown effects before mixing
- the mixer needs to send the product to the customer
- show mixing output while doing so
- unknown effects need to unlock
- the customer orders need to loop until none left

--- I think this is the cutoff of what is reasonably possible ---

But the list continues anyway:
- add money counter
- add inventory, instead of listing all ingredients in mixer
- add shop

My best idea is trying to get the art done in 1 day...
