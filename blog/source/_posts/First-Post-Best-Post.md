*It's all downhill from here*

Welcome readers! I decided - way too soon, just a few months into my gamedev learning arc - to join a Game Jam, and just as I did, Brackeys Jam arrived. I also want to document my process, and hopefully progress on this blog.

I aim to post twice a day, in the morning with the days plan, and in the evening, with what I learned/achieved. We'll see how that goes.

The Game Jam started earlier today (the theme is "Risk it for the Biscuit", for those no familiar), but due to prior commitments I will be unable to get to it until tomorrow morning. For this reason, I elected to do this solo as well. Seemed unfair to join a team and leave them alone for the first day.

Since I am:
- solo
- fairly inexperienced (never completed a game)
- and a day short
- good at the code stuff, but useless at the art stuff

it is entirely possible I will not finish this thing, and bail out around Thursday/Friday. We'll see.

Nevertheless, while I could not start today, I was able to do a bit of brainstorming - I only promised I would be there somewhere today, I never promised I wouldn't thousand-yard stare the whole day, thinking about risks and biscuits - and I can hopefully deploy this blog quickly before going to bed.

So I am like 90% set on the game idea I want to do.
