## Dependencies
- https://hexo.io for blogging
- https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit
    - for vscode the `gdscript-formatter-linter` extension is necessary, which is kind of hard to get on Code - OSS https://EddieDover.gallery.vsassets.io/_apis/public/gallery/publisher/EddieDover/extension/gdscript-formatter-linter/1.4.3/assetbyname/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.VSIXPackage
- https://pre-commit.com/
    - do not forget to `pre-commit install` the hooks
- https://frame0.app/ (for mockup editing)
- while the godot executable can be anywhere, I'll assume it's in `godot/godot` for all of my QoL features
